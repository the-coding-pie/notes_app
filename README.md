# Notes App
A simple Notes App made using React JS, Redux and Django Rest Framework.

I was trying to connect my Django, React JS and Redux skills together, so I did this.

This is a simple note taking app with Token Based Authentication.

## How to use it?

I separated the Django backend from the ReactJS frontend. One of the many ways to run this project is to run the Django backend API alone and then use the ReactJS frontend to consume the API.

So first let's switch on the backend API:

- `git clone` or `Download ZIP` this repo `https://github.com/the-coding-pie/notes_app.git`
- then `cd notes_app/backend/backend`
-
